NON VERBAL, VERBAL REASONING

1)  NON VERBAL REASONING
    A)  CLOCKS -
        Minute hand one rotation    60 minutes = 360 degree -->     1 min = 6 degree
        Hour hand one rotation      12 hrs = 360 degree     -->     1 hr = 30 degree    --> 1 min = 0.5 degree 
        Angle difference between both hands of the clock in 1 min   5.5 degree

        Case 1 -    When both hands of the clock at 90 degree. 
                    In 1 hour 2 situations. 
                    In 12 hrs 22 situations because between 2-4 and 8-10 there will be 3 right angles each instead of 4.
                    In 24 hrs 44 situations.
                    Formula - 60*(Time +- 3)/11.
                    +-3 because we have quadrant in right angle
        Case 2 -    When both hands of the clock at 180 degree/ Opposite/ Straight line.
                    In 1 hour 1 situation.
                    In 12 hrs 11 situations because 5-7 only 1 situation instead of 2.
                    In 24 hrs 22 situations.
                    Formula - 60*(Time +- 6)/11, Time is such that result is positive.
                    +-6 because we have semicircle in straight line 
        Case 3 -    When both hands overlap/ 0 degree/ 360 degree.
                    In 1 hour 1 situation.
                    In 12 hrs 11 situations because 11-1 only 1 situation instead of 2.
                    In 24 hrs 22 situations.
                    Formula - 60*Time/11
                    +-0 since no quadrant.
        Case 4 -    When time is given and find the angle
                    Formula -> Angle = 11*min/2 - 30*hour 
        Case 5 -    When angle is given and find time 
                    Formula -> +-Angle = 11*min/2 - 30*hour
                    +- since two situations
        Case 6 -    Mr. X went to market between 4 to 5 pm and came back between 7 to 8 pm. He noticed that the hour and minute hand interchanged there places. Find the time he left 
                    Time he left ---> 4: 60/13 -> 4: 60*8/13 -> 4: 480/13
                    Time he came back ---> 7: 60*5/13 -> 7: 300/13
        Case 7 -    Mirror Image - Subtract from 11:60
        Case 8 -    Water Image - Subtract from 17:90


    B)  CALENDAR-
        Normal Year 365 Days, 52 Weeks and 1 Day(Odd days)
        Leap Year 366 days, 52 Weeks and 2 Days(Odd days)

        Case 1 -    Question - If 1 Jan 2020 was Friday. Find 1 Jan 2021       -   Sunday 
        Case 2 -    Question - Same calendar as of 2007                        -   2018
        Case 3 -    Question - Assume today is Friday, find day after 61 days  -   Wednesday
        Case 4 -    Find day on a particular date. 
                    Formula -> (Date + MonthCode + Year + LeapYear + CenturyCode) / 7
                    Day Code                    Year Code   Noraml Leap             Century Code                    LeapYear = Year/4
