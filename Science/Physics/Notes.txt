STRESS AND STRAIN -
    Stress - The internal restoring force acting per unit area of cross section. Newton/meter or Newton/meter^2

    Density - Ratio of Mass and Volume. kg/m^3. Density of water max at 40 degree. *Less Denser will float above
    Pressure - Force per unit area
    Pascal's Law - Liquids, pressure is transmitted undiminished in confined liquid. Ex - Hydraulic brakes
    Archemedes principle -  Upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Used in ships (Buoyant force). 
                            Ocean water is more denser, more ship volume will be replaced hence ship dont sink and stays low in water
    Surface Tension - Paper clip float on water, planets circular low Surface low suface tension
    Adhesion and Cohesion - Adhesion is attraction b/w two unlike molecules (Fevicol), Cohesion b/w same molecles
    Viscosity - Ability to flow. High viscosity less flow
    Streamlined and Turbulent Flow - Velocity at every point in fluid same is Streamlined 
    Bernauli's theorem - 

    Needle of iron swims when it is placed gently on water - Surface tension
    A boat will not submerge in water when it displaces water equal to its own - Volume
    Ice with lead in it floats on water. What will happen to level of water - Falls
    Oil floats on water why - because surface tension of oil is less than water
    Fountain pens principle - Capillarey Action
    Hairs of brush cling together when removed from water due to - Surface Tension
