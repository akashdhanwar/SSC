    DERIVED Units-
    *Force = Mass X Acceleration  kg m/s^2(Newton).                          1N = 10^5 dyne
    Speed = m/sec, Acceleration = m/sec^2
    Work Done = Force X Displacement (NewtonMeter)(kg m^2/sec^2)(Joule).    1J = 10^7 erg

    1 Chandrasekharan limit -   1.4 times mass of sun - 2.8 X 10^30 kg
    1 Solar Day             -   86400 sec
    1 Year                  -   365 1/2 solar days
    1 Lunar month           -   27.3 solar days
    Tropical Year           -   It is the year in which total solar eclipse occurs

    Dimensional Formulas as MLT - Pressure=F/A, Power=W/T, Force(MLT-2), 
    *Decibel(sound/noise), *Parsec(distance), *Pascal(Pressure), *Ohm(Resistance), *Hertz(Frequency), *Watt(Power)
    Farad(Capacitance), Siemens/Mho(conductance), Siemens per meter(Conductivity), Henry(Electrical Inductance), Weber(Magnetic Flux), Tesla(Magnetic Flux per unit square)
    Joule(Work Done/ Heat Energy), Calorie(Energy). 1 cal = 4.2 Joule

    MKS - metre kilo sec, CGS - cm gm sec, FPS - foot pound sec, SI  - almost same as MKS


    SUPPLEMENTARY Units-
    Radian and Steradian(solid angle Ex- cone)


    MOTION - Speed, Velocity, Distance, Displacement, Acceleration, Relative Velocity
    Equation of Motion in 1-D - v=u+at, s=ut+1/2 at^2, v^2-u^2=2as
    Uniform Circular motion - Speed constant but velocity changes since Angular acceleratrion is there due to direction but not in plane, hence no effect on speed. Tangential Acceleration is zero
    Projectile Motion - Range = u^2⋅sin2θ/g
                        Height = u^2⋅(sinθ)^2/2g
                        Time = 2u⋅sinθ/g
                        45 degrees max
    Newton's Laws - 1st - Law of Inertia or *Law of Galileo
                    2nd - Law of Acceleration or Law of Change of Momentum - Acceleration depends on mass of object. Mass is inverse to Acceleration. F = M X A.
                    3rd - *Conservation of Momentum, Action Reaction Law
    Momentum - Mass X Velocity
    Impulse is a force = Change in momentum, time is very less
    Friction -  Opposes slipping tendency, Opposite in case of box(Pushing) and forward in our slippers(Rolling)
                Static Friction > Kinetic/Sliding Friction
                *Angle of repose - Max angle, it is equal to angle of friction
    Centripetal and Centrifugal force - Centrifugal is a pseudo/virtual force

    *Free fall body - Uniform Acceleration
    *Kepler's laws - Govern the motion of planets
    *If a person throw ball from train, what will be its motion - Parabolic motion - moves on both x and y axis
    *Motion of wheel of bull cart is which motion - Rotatory and Transilatory Motion
    *Cricket ball and Tennis ball will fall in same time under gravity since it does not depend on mass, but we will need more force to stop high mass body
    *If mass= 60N. Find weight on moon. 60*10/6 = 100N
    *Rocket works on law of conservation of Linear Momentum
