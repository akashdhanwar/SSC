BRAIN- Question- positionwise and functionwise 
   Structure-
   Central organ of nervous system
   Including spinal cord with brain is central nervous system
   Parts - Cerebrum  Brainstem and Cerebellum
   Brain is connected to spinal cord
   Human like brain - Chimpanzee, Macaque(Bandar), Mouse
   Brain contains 65% fat
   
   Parts-
   1) Forebrain (Cerebrum, Thalamus, LimbicSystem(Hypothalamus))
   2) Midbrain (Smallest part of brain)
   3) Hindbrain (Cerebellum, Pons, Medulla)
   
   Cerebrum is the largest part in brain
   Functions - Interpret touch, Vision and hearing, Speech, Reasoning(Intelligence)(important), Learning and movement control
   
   Thalamus carries sensory information from the body to Cerebrum and limbic system
   It alerts brain Ex- garam tawa touch
   
   Limbic System is between Cerebrum and thalamus
   Functions - Hunger, Thirst, Fear, Anger, Sexual responses, control emotions
   Hypothalamus(important) release hormones and regulating body temperature
   Ex- khushi se aansu wala hormone

   Midbrain functions - control reflex(automatic) moments and hearing reflex
   Ex- byk speed slow legs down, awaz aai mundi ghoomi

   Cerebellum balance of body and voluntary moments(dance)
   Pons controls sleep, breathing pattern
   Medulla controls automatic action like breathing, blood circulation(important), hearth rate, swallowing 
   
   

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM-
   Organs-
   Mouth has buccal cavity, salivary gland 
   Salivary gland produces saliva
   Food pipe or Esophagus
   Stomach also known as JShepherd
   Liver - Biggest organ in digestive system
   Gall bladder removes chiknai 
   Pancreas on back side of liver - Release hormones
   Small and Large intestine
   Rectum and Anus
   Appendix - for digesting chlorophyll
   
   Process- 
   Mouth -> Salivary gland -> Stomach(3-4 hrs) -> Liver -> Small intestine -> Large intestine -> rectum -> anus
   Total length 9 metre of process (digestive gut). 1.5+ 6+ 1.5
   Parasteltic movement in Esophagus 
   Spinter holds food at different places
   First spinter between Stomach and liver for 3-4 hours until food digest in stomach
   Second spinter between liver and small intestine, in bile juice 
   Third spinter between and small and large intestine
   Last spinter in anus
   Water digest in 1 min
