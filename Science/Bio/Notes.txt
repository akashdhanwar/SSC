BRAIN- Question- positionwise and functionwise 
   Structure-
   Central organ of nervous system
   Including spinal cord with brain is central nervous system
   Parts - Cerebrum  Brainstem and Cerebellum
   Brain is connected to spinal cord
   Human like brain - Chimpanzee, Macaque(Bandar), Mouse
   Brain contains 65% fat
   
   Parts-
   1) Forebrain (Cerebrum, Thalamus, LimbicSystem(Hypothalamus))
   2) Midbrain (Smallest part of brain)
   3) Hindbrain (Cerebellum, Pons, Medulla)
   
   Cerebrum is the largest part in brain
   Functions - Interpret touch, Vision and hearing, Speech, Reasoning(Intelligence)(important), Learning and movement control
   
   Thalamus carries sensory information from the body to Cerebrum and limbic system
   It alerts brain Ex- garam tawa touch
   
   Limbic System is between Cerebrum and thalamus
   Functions - Hunger, Thirst, Fear, Anger, Sexual responses, control emotions
   Hypothalamus(important) release hormones and regulating body temperature
   Ex- khushi se aansu wala hormone

   Midbrain functions - control reflex(automatic) moments and hearing reflex
   Ex- byk speed slow legs down, awaz aai mundi ghoomi

   Cerebellum balance of body and voluntary moments(dance)
   Pons controls sleep, breathing pattern
   Medulla controls automatic action like breathing, blood circulation(important), hearth rate, swallowing 
   
   

DIGESTIVE SYSTEM-
   Five stages of digestive system-
   1. Ingestion - Intake of food
   2. Digestion
   3. Absorption - In Small Intestine(villies), absorbs nutritions. 
   4. Essimilation - In Large Intestine. Converts nutritions to energy.
   5. Excretion/Egestion

   Process- 
   Mouth(Buccal Cavity) -> Salivary gland -> Stomach(3-4 hrs) -> Liver -> Small intestine -> Large intestine -> rectum -> anus
   Total length 9 metre of process (digestive gut). 1.5+ 6+ 1.5
   Parasteltic movement in Esophagus 
   Spinter holds food at different places. First spinter between Stomach and liver for 3-4 hours until food digest in stomach. Second spinter between liver and small intestine, in bile juice. Third spinter between and small and large intestine. Last spinter in anus
   Water digest in 1 min

   Digestion Process-
   Food goes from mouth to Salivary gland 
   Salivary gland releases 3 enzymes - Ptylin, Maltose, Amylase. Digests CO2 and starch
   Now food in stomach. Stomach has 3 enzymes - HCl, Pepsin and Renin. HCl kills bacteria, pepsin digest protein and renin digest fat
   Now food in liver, bile juice from gall bladder and liver, yellowish green colour, Digests fat. Parallelly, Pancreas Juice from Pancreas - 3 enzymes - Tripsin digest protein, Amylase digest carbs and Lyphase digest fat
   Bile Duct is a pouch in which bile juice is there, pancreas juice also comes in this and food also comes in this
   Now food goes to Small intestine then to large intestine
   *Protein digests too late
   *Final digestion completes in Bile Duct

   *Teeth - 8+8+8+8 in adults 2123 - Inscissor Canine Premolar Molar. 5+5+5+5 teeth in children 2102
   *Wisdom Tooth - Last Molar (Akkal Daad) - Connected to brain
   *Pancreas(is on back side of liver) release 2 hormones - Insulin(converts sugar to glucose) and Glucagon(Stores as glucose)
   *Less insulin hence Diabetes
   *Food Pipe - Esophagus
   *Stomach - JShepherd
   *Liver - Biggest organ in digestive system
   *Gall bladder removes chiknai 
   *Appendix - for digesting chlorophyll - Vestigial Organ . Cow have biggest organ Appendix
