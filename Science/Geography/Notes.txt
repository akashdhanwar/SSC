SOLAR SYSTEM-
    Big Bang Theory -   An object SuperNova, temperature increased and exploded and gravitational pull formed and rotates
                        These gravitational pull are called galaxies, total 10^11 galaxies
                        Our Galaxy Milky way/ AakashGanga
                        Planets dont go out of solar system due to gravitational pull and people are bounded by gravitational bound
                        Solar system was formed 4.6 Billion years ago
                        Most mass is in Sun(Star), then in Jupiter(Planet)
                        Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars are composed of metals and rocks, Terestorial planets. Therefore magnetic altitude of Earth
                        Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune - Gas Grint. Uranus, Neptune - Ice Grint

    Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars - Inner Solar System
    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune - Outer Solar System

    SUN-
    Sun is the Father of Solar System.
